\section{Introduction}

In many programming algorithms, multiplication is a key step in driving the algorithm towards completion. 
Many digital signal processing algorithms spend most of their time multiplying values. Given our media heavy,
highly connected Internet of Things (IoT), more signals will need to be processed. Therefore, we have synthesized 
an iterative multiplier that supports the mul instruction as defined in the PARCv1 Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).
Eventually, this multiplier will be a module in a fully synthesizable multicore processor.

Computer Architecture - ECE 4750
=================

This course creates a multicore processor with on memory cache and a ring network spread across five labs.

In Lab 1 we make a multiplier for use in our processor. \newline
In Lab 2 we make a processor that implements the PARCv2 instruction set. \newline
In Lab 3 we make a cache for our processor, both direct mapped and 2-way set associative.
